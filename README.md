#Hangman: Lord of the Rings
This is my first javascript application. It is a Lord of the Rings style 
version of Hangman.
##How to Play
As soon as the page is loaded, the game will randomly select a name of 
an important character form The Lord of the Rings (the original trilogy) 
and display a blank space for every letter in that name. The game is 
played by pressing keys on the keyboard. If the key pressed corresponds 
to a letter in the name, the letter will fill the blank space(s) in which it 
appears in the name. Otherwise, it will be added to the "Already Guessed" 
category. The user has twelve chances to guess the letters in the name. 
If a letter guess is accurate, or if a letter has already been guessed, 
then the user does not forfeit a chance to guess. If the user either 
guesses all the letters correctly or runs out of chances to guess letters, 
then the game will automatically restart with another random word after 
a brief pause. 
##Other Notes
Have fun! If you win a round your reward is to try another round! :)
